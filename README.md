# GovRight Corpus Services

The `govright.corpusServices` module provides services for interacting with the models 
exposed by the LoopBack server via the REST API. Check the [documentation](http://govright.github.io/corpus-services/docs/#/api/govright.corpusServices)

   <script>
     // ...and add 'govright.corpusServices' as a dependency
     var myApp = angular.module('myApp', ['govright.corpusServices']);
